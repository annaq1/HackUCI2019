                <h3>Message from me:</h3>
                <p> I'm Mr. Popular. I like to play Smash. I have an internship 
                  so you'll know I'll be making bank ;). I LOVE anime. And I have 
                  many waifu pillows. I like to exert my popularity by bullying the 
                  unpopular. And FYI I am NOT gay!</p>

                <h3>Pros:</h3>
                 <p>- goes to UCI and majors in CGS
                    - has an internship<br>
                    - super loud so you'll never lose him in public <br>
                    - can handle his Soju<br>
                    - will put on falsies for you<br>
                </p> 
               
                <h3>Cons:</h3>
                <p> - Japanese but can't speak Japanese<br>
                    - eyes too small you can't tell if he's looking at you or not<br>
                    - loves anime and his switch more than he loves you
                </p>
